    Nate Darling: A Bit About Me
  </head>  
  <body><h1>A Bit About Me</h1><p>My name is Nate.  I am in the very beginning stages of learning how to use code.  Ultimately, my goal is to make a career switch from logistics to software development.  My interest in this field has grown quite a lot since 2020 so I figured I would give it a try.  I am nearly 8 years married with two daughters and last Sunday I ran my first half marathon and looking forward to finishing 5 more before the year ends</p>
